# HumanResourceManagementSystem
This is a capstone graduation project. The project revolves around creating a custom human resources management system for an existing organization. This project is written in C# programing language using visual studio. The system is web-based created using ASP.NET MVC 5.

The project is created based on functional requirements provided by the client organization. Based on the functional requirements the systems main functions are to log attendance, calculate payroll and generate reports based on performance and evaluations of the employees.
The need for creating a custom system rather than purchasing a commercial system is based on the organizations slightly unconventional calculation of the payroll. The payroll is calculated using attendance and worked hours in addition to factors such as type of education, level of experience, previous types working experience, performance of past tasks, personal networks and many more.  

For this project, the users of the proposed system are all members of the organization, that include CEO, administrator and team members (employees). 
The functional requirements of the human resources management system are as follow:  

Members should be able to view profiles, where they could edit the profile and view evaluation. 
Administrator should be able to log attendance. 
Members should be able to evaluate members and be evaluated. 
System should create performance reports and evaluation reports.

System should collect feedback from part-timers.  
Member should be able to input feedback before being removed from the system.
